# CE634-Project

This is the final project for the course Computer Simulation in fall 2021.

In this project we simulated a system with discrete events. This system has a scheduler which decides which server each task is assigned to. 
Each server has multiple cores. A core can only do one task at a time unit. Tasks can be of type 1 (with 10% chance) or 2 (with 90% chance) and type 1 tasks have higher
 priorities than type 2 tasks.
